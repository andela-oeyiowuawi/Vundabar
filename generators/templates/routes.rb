VundabarApp.routes.draw do
  # define your routes here
  # use root to define you landing routes
  # Example: root "pages#index"
  # This will ensure that the index action of the pagesController is your
  # default action
  # Available routes requests are get, post, put and delete
  # Each takes in an alias the first parameter and a hash as the second
  # The hash key is "to" while the value is the controller and action
  # Example get "user", to: "sessions#index"
  # You should define routes
  # You can also define routes with resources. just add resources :name and you
  # will have access to all restful urls
